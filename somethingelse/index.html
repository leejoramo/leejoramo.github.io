      <p>This blog is powered by <a href="http://hugo.spf13.com">Hugo</a>, a static site generator
written by Steve Francia (aka spf13).  It is, of course, written in Go.  It is
pretty similar to <a href="jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, in that you write markdown, run a
little program (hugo) and html pages come out the other end in the form of a
full static site.  What&rsquo;s different is that Jekyll is written in ruby and is
relatively slow, and Hugo is written in Go and is super fast&hellip; only taking a
few milliseconds to render each page.</p>

<p>Hugo includes a webserver to serve the content, which will regenerate the site
automatically when you change your content.  Your browser will update with the
changes immediately, making your development cycle for a site a very tight
loop.</p>

<p>The basic premise of Hugo is that your content is organized in a specific way on
purpose.  Folders of content and the name of the files combine to turn into the
url at which they are hosted. For example, content/foo/bar/baz.md will be hosted
at &lt;site&gt;/foo/bar/baz.</p>

<p>Every content file has a section of metadata at the top that allows you to
specify information about the content, like the title, date, even arbitrary data
for your specific site (for example, I have lists of badges that are shown on
pages for code projects).</p>

<p>All the data in a content file is just that - data.  Other than markdown
specifying a rough view of your page, the actual way the content is viewed is
completely separated from the data.  Views are written in Go&rsquo;s templating
language, which is quick to pick up and easy to use if you&rsquo;ve used other
templating languages (or even if, like me, you haven&rsquo;t).  This lets you do
things like iterate over all the entries in a menu and print them out in a ul/li
block, or iterate over all the posts in your blog and display them on the main
page.</p>

<p>You can learn more about Hugo by going to <a href="http://hugo.spf13.com">its site</a>,
which, of course, is built using Hugo.</p>

<p>The static content for this site is hosted on github pages at
<a href="https://github.com/natefinch/natefinch.github.io">https://github.com/natefinch/natefinch.github.io</a>. But the static content is
relatively boring&hellip; that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re looking at in your browser right now.
What&rsquo;s interesting is the code behind it.  That lives in a separate repo on
github at <a href="https://github.com/natefinch/npf">https://github.com/natefinch/npf</a>.  This is where the markdown content
and templates live.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how I have things set up locally&hellip; all open source code on my machine
lives in my GOPATH (which is set to my HOME).  So, it&rsquo;s easy to find anything I
have ever downloaded. Thus, the static site lives at
$GOPATH/src/github.com/natefinch/natefinch.github.io and the markdown +
templates lives in $GOPATH/src/github.com/natefinch/npf.  I created a symbolic
link under npf called public that points to the natefinch.github.io directory.
This is the directory that hugo outputs the static site to by default&hellip; that
way Hugo dumps the static content right into the correct directory for me to
commit and push to github.  I just had to add public to my .gitignore so
everyone wouldn&rsquo;t get confused.</p>

<p>Then, all I do is go to the npf directory, and run</p>

<pre><code>hugo new post/urlofpost.md
hugo server --buildDrafts --watch -t hyde
</code></pre>

<p>That generates a new content item that&rsquo;ll show up on my site under
/post/urlofpost.  Then it runs the local webserver so I can watch the content by
pointing a browser at localhost:1313 on a second monitor as I edit the post in a
text editor. hyde is the name of the theme I&rsquo;m using, though I have modified
it.  Note that hugo will mark the content as a draft by default, so you need
&ndash;buildDrafts for it to get rendered locally, and remember to delete the draft =
true line in the page&rsquo;s metadata when you&rsquo;re ready to publish, or it won&rsquo;t show
up on your site.</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m satisfied, kill the server, and run</p>

<pre><code>hugo -t hyde
</code></pre>

<p>to generate the final site output, switch into the public directory, and</p>

<pre><code>git commit -am &quot;some new post&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s it.  Super easy, super fast, and no muss.  Coming from Blogger, this is
an amazingly better workflow with no wrestling with the WYSIWYG editor to make
it display stuff in a reasonable fashion.  Plus I can write posts 100% offline
and publish them when I get back to civilization.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more to Hugo, and a lot more I want to do with the site, but that
will come in time and with more posts :)</p>
