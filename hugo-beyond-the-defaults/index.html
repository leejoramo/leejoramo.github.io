      <p>In my last post, I had deployed what is almost the most basic Hugo site
possible.  The only reason it took more than 10 minutes is because I wanted to
tweak the theme.  However, there were a few things that immediately annoyed me.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t like having to type <code>hugo -t hyde</code> all the time.  Well, turns out
that&rsquo;s not necessary.  You can just put  <code>theme = &quot;hyde&quot;</code> in your site
config, and never need to type it again.  Sweet.  Now to run the local server, I
can just run <code>hugo server -w</code>, and for final generation, I can just run <code>hugo</code>.</p>

<p>Next is that my posts were under npf.io/post/postname &hellip; which is not the end
of the world, but I really like seeing the date in post URLs, so that it&rsquo;s easy
to tell if I&rsquo;m looking at something really, really old.  So, I went about
looking at how to do that.  Turns out, it&rsquo;s trivial.  Hugo has a feature called
<a href="http://hugo.spf13.com/extras/permalinks">permalinks</a>, where you can define the
format of the url for a section (a section is a top level division of your site,
denoted by a top level folder under content/).  So, all you have to do is, in
your site&rsquo;s config file, put some config that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>[permalinks]
    post = &quot;/:year/:month/:filename/&quot;
    code = &quot;/:filename/&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>While we&rsquo;re at it, I had been putting my code in the top level content
directory, because I wanted it available at npf.io/projectname  &hellip;. however
there&rsquo;s no need to do that, I can put the code under the code directory and just
give it a permalink to show at the top level of the site.  Bam, awesome, done.</p>

<p>One note: Don&rsquo;t forget the slash at the end of the permalink.</p>

<p>But wait, this will move my &ldquo;Hugo is Friggin&rsquo; Awesome&rdquo; post to a different URL,
and Steve Francia already tweeted about it with the old URL.  I don&rsquo;t want that
url to send people to a 404 page!
<a href="http://hugo.spf13.com/extras/aliases">Aliases</a> to the rescue.  Aliases are just
a way to make redirects from old URLs to new ones.  So I just put <code>aliases =
[&quot;/post/hugo-is-awesome/&quot;]</code> in the metadata at the top of that post, and now
links to there will redirect to the new location.  Awesome.</p>

<p>Ok, so cool&hellip; except that I don&rsquo;t really want the content for my blog posts
under content/post/ &hellip; I&rsquo;d prefer them under content/blog, but still be of type
&ldquo;post&rdquo;.  So let&rsquo;s change that too.  This is pretty easy, just rename the folder
from post to blog, and then set up an
<a href="http://hugo.spf13.com/content/archetypes">archetype</a> to default the metadata
under /blog/ to type = &ldquo;post&rdquo;.  Archetypes are default metadata for a section,
so in this case, I make a file archetypes/blog.md and add type= &ldquo;post&rdquo; to the
archetype&rsquo;s metadata, and now all my content created with <code>hugo new
blog/foo.md</code> will be prepopulated as type &ldquo;post&rdquo;.  (does it matter if the type
is post vs. blog?  no.  But it matters to me ;)</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mlafeldt">@mlafeldt</a> on Twitter pointed out my RSS feed was
wonky&hellip;. wait, I have an RSS feed?  Yes, Hugo <a href="http://hugo.spf13.com/templates/rss">has that
too</a>.  There are feed XML files
automatically output for most listing directories&hellip; and the base feed for the
site is a list of recent content.  So, I looked at what Hugo had made for me
(index.xml in the root output directory)&hellip; this is not too bad, but I don&rsquo;t
really like the title, and it&rsquo;s including my code content in the feed as well as
posts, which I don&rsquo;t really want.  Luckily, this is trivial to fix.  The RSS xml
file is output using a Go template just like everything else in the output.
It&rsquo;s trivial to adjust the template so that it only lists content of type
&ldquo;post&rdquo;, and tweak the feed name, etc.</p>

<p>I was going to write about how I got the series stuff at the bottom of this
page, but this post is long enough already, so I&rsquo;ll just make that into its own
post, as the next post in the series! :)</p>
